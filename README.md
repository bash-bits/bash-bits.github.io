## üëç [Supporting the Project](#toc)

The creation and maintenance of Open Source Software is definitely a labour of love - this is never going to be a path to riches.  The truth is, it takes not only a lot of time, it creates a substantial amount of personal expense (even when you're working on a shoestring) to keep these projects freely available for all.

If you'd like more info about how you can help out, head to my [Sponsor's Page][sponsors]
